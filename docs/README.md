# Juke User Guide

Welcome to the `Juke` User Guide! Through this user guide, you will:

* Learn what is `Juke` and how it can help you to track your tasks
* Learn the features of `Juke`
* Learn the commands that `Juke` can understand

Let's get started!

## Getting Started

As `Juke` is a GUI application, you will need to install the relevant Java GUI libraries on 
your machine.

### Setting Up

To use `Juke`, you will need to install `Java 11` on your machine. You can find out more on 
how you can install `Java 11` on your 
[Windows machine](https://docs.azul.com/core/zulu-openjdk/install/windows), 
[MacOS machine](https://docs.azul.com/core/zulu-openjdk/install/macos) or
[Linux machine](https://docs.azul.com/core/zulu-openjdk/install/debian) by clicking on the hyperlinked
text.

Ensure that you are downloading the latest version of `Java 11` from the websites which contain
the `JavaFX` library prepackaged in it.

{% include warning.html content="If you decide not to use the above <pre>Java 11</pre> JDKs for 
any reason, ensure that the JDK you decide to use is at least <pre>Java 11</pre> and you install 
the relevant <pre>JavaFX</pre> library along with the installation of the JDK!" %}

Next, head to [this website](https://github.com/asdfghjkxd/ip/releases) and download the latest JAR file 
attached in the latest release of `Juke`.

### Running `Juke`

Open up your device's terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the location where the JAR file is 
downloaded into using the `cd` command. Click [here](https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-cd-in-linux) 
to learn more about the `cd` command.

Finally, run the command `java -jar juke.jar` to start `Juke`!

## Features 

`Juke` is packed full of features to help you track your tasks!

### Add a `Todo` Task

You can add a `Todo` Task to help you track the tasks that you need to do! `Todo` tasks have 
no deadlines, and are represented only by its completion status!

#### Usage

`todo [task name]`

{% include warning.html content="The task name you enter <strong>cannot</strong>
just be one or more spaces!" %}

#### Examples

* `todo this is also a valid task`
* `todo task 1 is also a valid task`

#### Expected Outcome

If successful, `Juke` will respond with:

```
Task added: [T] [ ] <YOUR TASK NAME>
```

#### Possible Errors

The following are examples of errors that could happen to the `todo` command:

* `todo`: When the argument is ommitted, an error will occur

---

### Add a `Deadline` Task

Create a `Deadline` Task to track completable tasks with a deadline!

#### Usage

`deadline [task name] /by [(DD(- OR /)MM(- OR /)YYYY HH(: or -)MM) OR (DD(- OR /)MM(- OR /)YYYY)]`

* Note the following
    * `DD`: 2-digit number representing the day
    * `MM`: 2-digit number representing the month
    * `YYYY`: 4-digit number representing the year
    * `HH`: 2-digit number representing the hour in 24 hours
    * `MM`: 2-digit number representing the minutes

{% include warning.html content="The task name you enter <strong>cannot</strong>
just be one or more spaces!" %}

#### Examples

* `deadline task /by 01/01/2023 23:59`
* `deadline other valid task /by 01/01/2023`

#### Expected Outcome

If successful, `Juke` will respond with:

```
Task added: [D] [ ] <YOUR TASK NAME> (by <TASK DEADLINE>)
```

#### Possible Errors

The following are examples of errors that could happen to the `deadline` command:

* `deadline`, `deadline /by`: When the arguments are ommitted, an error will occur
* `deadline error task /by gibberish`: When the date argument is invalid, an error will occur

---

### Create an `Event` Task

Create `Event` Tasks to track completable tasks with start and end dates!

#### Usage

```
event [task name] /from [(DD(- OR /)MM(- OR /)YYYY HH(: or -)MM) OR (DD(- OR /)MM(- OR /)YYYY)]
/to [(DD(- OR /)MM(- OR /)YYYY HH(: or -)MM) OR (DD(- OR /)MM(- OR /)YYYY)]
```

* Note the following
    * `DD`: 2-digit number representing the day
    * `MM`: 2-digit number representing the month
    * `YYYY`: 4-digit number representing the year
    * `HH`: 2-digit number representing the hour in 24 hours
    * `MM`: 2-digit number representing the minutes

{% include note.html content="The date formats used in <pre>event</pre> follows closely to what 
<pre>deadline</pre> uses!" %}

{% include warning.html content="The task name you enter <strong>cannot</strong> 
just be one or more spaces!" %}

#### Examples

* `event task /from 01/01/2023 23:59 /to 01/01/2024 23:59`
* `deadline other valid task /from 01/01/2023 /to 01/01/2024 23:59`

#### Expected Outcome

If successful, `Juke` will respond with:

```
Task added: [E] [ ] <YOUR TASK NAME> (from <TASK START DATE> to <TASK END DATE>)
```

#### Possible Errors

The following are examples of errors that could happen to the `event` command:

* `event`, `event /from`, `event /from /to`: When the arguments are ommitted, an error will occur
* `event error task /from gibberish /to gibberish 2`: When the date argument is invalid, an error will occur
